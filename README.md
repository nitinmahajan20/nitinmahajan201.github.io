## List of Projects

### [Project 1 California House Price Prediction](https://github.com/nitinmahajan20/California-House-Price-)

To buy a house is on everyone' checklist. One of the most important factors in buying a house is the income or the money each household have. Besides other factor include location, distance from work, the size of the house etc. Buyer considers these factors while looking for a house in the market. Prediction of the housing value is therefore dependent on these factors. Considering these values as the predictor for the housing prices will also help the government, private companies, insurance companies and real estate agent to invest money accordingly.

### [Project 2 Analyzing the single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNASeq) data and assigning cell type identity](https://github.com/nitinmahajan20/scRNA)

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made single-cell sequencing an increasingly powerful tool for understanding the biology and cellular function, disease diagnosis, therapy response prediction, and treatment selection. Historically, sequencing technology only enabled an average analysis of a total cell population (Bulk RNA-Seq). In contrast, today, tens of thousands of individual cells from a single tissue sample or patient can be analyzed, giving researchers an unprecedented opportunity to understand individual cell populations and their behavior in diseased tissue. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for detecting and quantifying messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in biological samples and is helpful in exploring cellular responses. Majorly there are two RNA sequencing - bulk RNA and single single-cell (scRNASeq). The advantage of scRNASeq is to identify and discover the rare populations and mutations which is helpful to understanding cancer, cardiac disorders. Identifying different and new cell populations is important for developing new therapy and diagnosis. However, analyzing the large volumes of data generated from these experiments requires specialized statistical and computational methods. We will use the data from 10X genomics and identify the different cell type clusters based on the expression of different genes. Cells will be treated as rows (samples), and gene expression will be as columns (Variables). This white paper describes the single cell RNA- Seq data analysis for identifying different cell populations in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using R based platform Seurat. 

### [Project 2 Walmart Sales Forecasting] 

### [Project 3 - Predicting-Movie-Ratings-from-Reviews](https://github.com/nitinmahajan20/Predicting-Movie-Ratings-from-Reviews-Using-Naive-Bayes)

Naïve Bayes is used to predict the movie rating from reviews. 

### [Project 4 -	AirBnb_2019_Austin_Crimes_Map](https://github.com/nitinmahajan20/Austin_AirBnb_Crime_Data_2019)

I did this project to practice python using machine elarning to explore the AirBnb 2019 data from Austin. Also, in this I joined the data for crimes and mapped using zipcode.



### Project 2 - Building Weather App – We used python and API to build the weather app. 
### Project 3 - Air Travel – How safe is Air Travel? – This project we completed as a part of course DSC640. 
### Project 4 - Identification of significant variables to drive the price of used cars on eBay – A project from the course DSC530 where we did the Identification of significant variables to drive the price of used cars on eBay
### Project 5 - world happiness report before the COVID – Project I submitted for the course DSC550, where I explored the happiness data just before the Covid 19. 


### Project 9 - Project 2 From DSC680
### Project 10 -  From DSC680
